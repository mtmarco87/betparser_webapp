## Project Overview

BetParser WebApp is a tool designed to empower sports betting enthusiasts and analysts by providing actionable insights into live betting odds. By leveraging Firebase for real-time data synchronization, the app ensures users can access up-to-date information on SureBets and ValueBets. Additionally, its integration with [BetParser Crawler](https://github.com/mtmarco87/betparser_crawler) allows seamless access to parsed betting data, creating a unified ecosystem for betting analysis. Built with Angular, the app prioritizes responsiveness and ease of use, making it suitable for both casual users and professional analysts.

## Features

- **Live Odds Analysis**: View and analyze live betting odds in real-time.
- **SureBets and ValueBets Detection**: Automatically identify profitable betting opportunities.
- **Firebase Integration**: Seamlessly sync and access shared data.

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

1. Install a package manager:

   - [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) (recommended)
   - [Node-NPM](https://nodejs.org/it/download/)

2. Install global tools:

   ```bash
   yarn global add @angular/cli firebase-tools
   # or
   npm install -g @angular/cli firebase-tools
   ```

3. Verify global tools:
   Ensure Angular CLI and Firebase CLI are installed globally.  
   Use the following commands to check versions:

   ```bash
   ng version
   firebase --version
   ```

   Required versions:

   - **Angular CLI**: Version >= 8
   - **Firebase CLI**: Version > 7.5

### Setup Steps

- Install dependencies:  
  Open a terminal in the project folder and run:

  ```bash
  yarn install
  # or
  npm install
  ```

### Configuration

1. Firebase DB:  
   This app requires the same Firebase DB used by [BetParser Crawler](https://github.com/mtmarco87/betparser_crawler). Ensure you configure the following files with the Firebase DB settings (API key, domain, URL, etc.):

   - `src/environment/environment.ts`
   - `src/environment/environment.prod.ts`

> **Note**: The shared Firebase DB contains the `parsed_bets` collection, which stores the parsed betting data.

2. Google Maps (Optional):  
   To enable Google Maps features, replace the `YOUR_MAPS_API_KEY` placeholder in `src/index.html` with your Google Maps API key.

3. Firebase WebApp Deployment (Optional):  
   Deploy the app to Firebase using these commands:

   ```bash
   ng build --prod
   firebase login --interactive
   firebase deploy
   ```

   Additional configuration may be required to set up the target project/cloud storage on Firebase.
